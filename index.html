        <h1>Hi, I'm UX/UI Designer and Frontend Developer</h1>
        <p>My name is Aida Burlutckaia</p> 
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello again! I'm Aida, a designer and frontend developer living in Connecticut, USA. Since 2012, I've enjoyed turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive designs. As a visual storyteller, I transform any concept into a unique visual language with a touch of magic.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm diving into frontend development, and this website you're on is a testament to my skills. I'm learning JS, HTML, CSS, and I'm loving every bit of it. When I'm not pushing pixels or coding, you'll find me hiking, traveling, spending time with family, or working on DIY projects.</p>
